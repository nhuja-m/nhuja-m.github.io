            I lay in bed unable to understand the lyrics that reached my ears. The song was sung in the obsolete language of Newari. I struggled to catch some familiar words and recognised the song: Sitalamaju, a Newari classic.

This incident took me back to the place where I had heard these few Newari words: my ancestral home. The house must've weathered at least a century of seasonal cycles; it smelled like soil and its wooden pillars had shriveled, which seemed to me at that time like breakable sticks. I used to pray every night before I slumbered under its roof. Jumping was forbidden inside, but during the fateful Gorkha earthquake of 2015, I did not need to move an inch. I was in that very house with my family when it almost buried us.

My old fears resurfaced with this memory. The ceiling seemed to be speeding at me. I felt suffocated and got up. The sounds of tribal instruments entranced my ears, yet the lyrics remained undecipherable.

Curious to decrypt the song, I googled its English translation. “Drums beating, kids’ bodies thrown into Koshi river, sadness”. I had dug up a morgue with my ears. Sitalamaju told the story of how the then King of Nepal banished smallpox-infected children out of the country to prevent an outbreak... a disease that no longer exists.

Baffled by the legends and stories my culture held, I felt drained that I couldn’t speak Newari. People are giving up on this ancient subdivision of Nepali culture, its language, and history. So, I asked my parents to start conversing with me in this seemingly alien tongue. I tried decrypting more Newari songs, attempting to resurrect a dying language and refusing to give up on my heritage.

Yet soon, I found this personal project weighing down on me. I had thought that it was upon us youngsters to curate cultural heritage, but this culture turned out to be too vast and its language too rich. I couldn’t possibly learn Newari as easily as I had hoped to. I stuttered a lot and didn’t know how crucial ceremonies like the coming-of-age ceremony were executed. Not knowing things about my own house, I thought I had failed to learn.

But one day I had an epiphany. The fact that the house of my legacy has cracked and is crumbling with time was suffocating to visualize. However, I had been so bent on preserving my heritage as fundamental to my identity, I had forgotten the fundamentals of being human: having limitations. I knew I couldn’t preserve every idea from my ancestors for the next generation, but I can always try to the best of my ability. 

I felt rejuvenated, and my enthusiasm for Newari returned. Besides learning the tongue, I also wanted to focus on the deeper narrative that it implied. After all, a culture is more than what is spoken and how things are done. There are some jokes in Newari that don’t make sense when translated to other languages. It was a secret vault with more things in life to laugh about. I began to see that those jokes connected my family like nothing else. I had been looking at buildings while the rods that held them up had remained invisible.

Recently, my father told me Newar people used a strange art to build their houses: grip-locking wooden logs that could give a strong foundation to even a structure of clay. The reason we didn’t die in 2015! 

The house is not heritage but a symbol of mortality. It reminds me there’ll always be many things left to learn, and it is not how much I gain but how much of an impact I let it make on myself that matters the most.

    I wrote this essay for my college application in 2019. It remains to me one of the most important documents.
